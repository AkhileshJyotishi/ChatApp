signalling server=help to exchange necessary info to establish connection between users,we can use socket, httprequset

turn server =traversal using relay net and its a protocol for relaying network traffic
it works when stun server

stun server is giving us the ice candidates details which contain the user internet connection information

ICE candidate = information about internet connectoion , typically user send its best candidat first but generally they are UDP

Session description protocol===
                                format to describe multimedia communication sessions for purposes of session announcement and 
                                session invitation ,, it contain timing information of audio and video and their codecs




                                -------------MESH =multiple direct connections
                                =------------mcu = multipoint control units
                                -------------sfu= selective forwarding units 
                                

                                limitations with mesh == it works with less no of users and it also work less efficiently for low spec users 
                                if there are x user then x^x connections are there
